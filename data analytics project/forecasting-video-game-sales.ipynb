I've been learning Python on-and-off for just over a year and Machine Learning on my own from books for about a year now. So any feedback is more than welcome, thanks!\n\nThe purpose of this Kernel is to investigate whether or not an accurate Machine Learning model can be built to forecast video game sales in units based on the features given in this dataset. This hypothesis is investigated with numerous supervised ML models.\n\nUltimately, a decision to forecast only aggregated global sales was made due to the inherently global nature of the video game industry. Several features were droppped in the process as well due to a huge potential influx of dummy variables post-feature engneering. \n\nSeven models were trained, out of which the lowest MSRE and best generalization is seen achieved by a Gradient Boosting Regressor model, which managed to outperform my first ever Deep Neural Network.\n\nAs a whole, this sort of prediction model could be used as one input out of many in business teams working for large video game developers.\n\nA huge thanks to @Anisotropic, @Serigne and @juliencs! I learned a lot from your notebooks (see below) and I've directly copied some of your code.

Instead it's the Gradient Boosting Regressor. I would have initially picked it out to be the second best one out of the lot. This speaks to it's power as a model and also to the fact that training deep neural networks is challenging and a lot of the time it seems that you're better off choosing a simpler model, as the computational expense that DNN's bring with them may not justify the decrease in MSRE. In a sense it's kind of a \"don't bring a gun to a fistfight\" type of situation, if that makes any sense... \n\nAs this was my first time training a neural network, it really dawned on me how difficult tuning those hyperparameters is to optimize your model. At the same time I can more clearly see the value in using a library like Tensorflow for training DNN's as the library brings more flexibility that can prove to be invaluable. \n\nAnyway, on to the analysis of the results! So the GBR's best cross-validation score and its test score are both 0.33 as measured in RMSE. This means that first off, the model generalizes well as the difference between the cross-validation score and the test set score is negligible. In more concrete terms however, it means that the average error the model makes in its predicitons amount to 330k units. That means that in making a forecast, on average the model will be wrong in forecasting video game sales by 330k units.\n\nAdditionally, an interesting finding is that the amount of users and the amount of critics rating a game on Metacritic is more important in explaining the results than the scores themselves. My initial hypothesis would have been the other way around. In this regard, it seems that it doesn't necessarily matter as much that a game has a single esteemed critic scoring the game a 100, but rather that the game has lots of critics scoring it potentially even at a lower level to drive those unit sales.\n\nAnother interesting finding is that the year of release is the fifth most important factor in explaingin the results. I would wager here that this is an indication of the fast growing video game industry: as the value for the year increases, unit sales increases mainly due to the market itself growing.\n\nIn terms of platforms, the only ones that maintained some relevant measure of explanatory power was whether the game was released on PC and whether it was released on Wii. There may be many interpretations here, so it is best to be wary in interpreting this. A game being released on Wii might speak towards explaining lower unit sales due to the platform not being as popular as it's counter parts PS3 and Xbox 360. In the case of a game being released on PC, it is difficult to say which way this explanatory power goes, as PC is such a large platform with all kinds of games being released on it.\n\nHowever, let's get to the real question: is the model good or not?\n\nWell, it depends on the point of view. If you would use this model to forecast the unit sales of a small video game developer's game, you would be better of using other methods. The reason is that typically independent smaller studios sell under a million copies. In this case, an error of 330k units is a lot and can have a tremendous financial impact on the company, if you are relying on forecasting sales with this model. However, if you use this model to forecast the unit sales of larger AAA game developer's game, an error of 330k units, isn't that fatal. If you're forecasting the unit sales of a developer who typically sells say 3 million copies, then a roughly 10 % deviation is not fatal. Sure it isn't close to perfect, but these type of models typically aren't.\n\nSo where might this model come in valuable then? I think the most obvious example is in business teams in large video game companies. They typically make sales estimates that are then reflected in project budgets etc. and most of the time, the estimates are made in similar ways that for example equity analysts make forecasts: coming up with a number off of the top of your head :) This model could thus be used as an extra input in making those sales forecasts. \n\nTo finish off: creating this kernel was a lot of fun! I appreciate all types of feedback as I'm only a beginner in both Python and Machine Learning! Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\n\n-jruots\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"c03267600e168d72fbb75a44084121569e4455bd","_cell_guid":"4a745698-4236-4aa7-8be7-932c01490576"}}]}
